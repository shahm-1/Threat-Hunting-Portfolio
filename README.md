# 🕵️ Threat Hunting Portfolio

End-to-end threat investigations using enterprise-grade tools, real attack scenarios, and production-level logging.

**7 complete investigations** — from initial detection through remediation. Each demonstrates hands-on experience with SIEM platforms, EDR tools, and incident response workflows.

## 🎯 My Approach

I build realistic enterprise environments, simulate attacks (or investigate live threats), then conduct investigations using actual security tools. Each investigation includes full timeline reconstruction, evidence collection, and remediation recommendations.

**What makes this enterprise-focused:**
- Real tools (Microsoft Sentinel, Splunk, Defender for Endpoint)
- Complete telemetry (audit logs, process execution, network traffic)
- Actual attack techniques mapped to MITRE ATT&CK
- Investigation reports written for security teams

## 📚 Investigations

| Investigation | Focus Area | Key Skills |
|---------------|------------|------------|
| **[Azuki Import/Export](./01-Azuki-Import-Export-Investigation/)** | Network & Data Movement | Traffic analysis, data staging detection, process correlation |
| **[Internet-Exposed VM: Brute Force](02-Internet-Exposed-Brute-Force/)** | Authentication Attacks | Failed login analysis, IP reputation, threat patterns |
| **[Tor Browser Investigation](./03-Tor-Browser-Investigation/)** | Endpoint Detection | Process tracking, persistence mechanisms, network indicators |
| **[Data Exfiltration Case](./04-Data-Exfiltration-Case/)** | Insider Threat | File access monitoring, lateral movement, staging analysis |
| **[Network Slowdown Analysis](./05-Network-Slowdown-Analysis/)** | Performance Anomalies | Traffic baseline deviation, compromised endpoint identification |
| **[Zero-Day Ransomware Response](./06-Zero-Day-Ransomware-Response/)** | Incident Response | Containment, evidence preservation, rapid IOC development |
| **[NIST 800-61 IR Workflow](./07-NIST-Incident-Response-Workflow/)** | IR Framework | Full lifecycle: detection → recovery → lessons learned |

**→ Each folder contains a complete investigation report with timeline, evidence, and findings.**
